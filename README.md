# DSCI 511: Programming for Data Science

Overview of data structures, iteration, flow control, and program design relevant to data exploration and analysis. When and how to exploit pre-existing packages/libraries.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

1. Translate fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals into R and Python code.
2. Translate a computational problem into efficient R and Python code.
3. Understand and implement the basics of object-oriented programming in Python. 
4. Understand how to write functions in both R and Python.
5. Produce human-readable code that incorporates best practices of programming and coding style. 
6. Predict the output of code based on R's scoping rules. 

## Annotated Resources

Here are prominent course resources that we will be referring to:

1. [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
	- The Python documentation is a great resource for learning Python especially the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). 
2. [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)
	- "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" is a standard textbook for introductory programming courses. It includes case studies and exercises.
3. [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Wickham (free version online)
	- This is a prominent resource for R as a programming language, allowing the reader to dig deep into R. It anticipates readers to already have some programming background. Its first part on Foundations is closely aligned with the objectives of DSCI 511, and is therefore the textbook for the second half of the course. Gaining familiarity with this book will likely be an asset in your data science career.
4. [R swirl](https://swirlstats.com/)
	- For those new to R who want more practice with the basics.

Here are other resources that you might find useful:

* [Hands-On Programming with R](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/ighbo26t3ua52t/igp9099yy4v10/igz7vp4w5su9/OReilly_HandsOn_Programming_with_R_2014.pdf) by RStudio's Garrett Grolemund
	- If you find "Advanced R" too be too technical for your liking, try this book. It's along the same vein, but less technical.

* [Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/) (a lot of good stuff here, for many MDS courses!)
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
